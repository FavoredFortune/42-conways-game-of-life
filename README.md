#Canvas Manipulation Lab
Conway's Game of Life

#Overview
Create a game application that combines traditional Java programming with Android capabilities, especially Canvas and draw, to build a game.
Game is modeled after a famous algorithm called ["Conway's Game of Life"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

#User Story
As a user I want to be able to click on a blank white canvas as many times as I like to turn squares black (or white again) to set up a "population".
Then I want to be able to hit a "tick" button that simulates a journey of each black cell towards a stable population. 

###Stretch Goal
As a user I would also like to know, each time I play the game, how many squares I turn black and how many times I have to "tick" to get a stable population.
